# Julia playground

Because I have to have a [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) repo.

Test to see if Github's markdown supports Julia:

```julia
function sayhi(name)
    println("Hi $name, it's great to see you!")
end
```

I recommned this [Intro to Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPYgipsg4DM).
